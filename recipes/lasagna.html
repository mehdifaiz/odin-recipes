    <h2>THIS IS LASAGNA üáÆüáπ</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">An Italian food menu just wouldn‚Äôt be complete without lasagna listed on it. The dish is a dinner favorite at Earth, Wind & Flour, other restaurants, and many households across the world.
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Lasagna (plural ‚Äúlasagne‚Äù) is a flat and expanded pasta sheet, traditionally made in Italy with Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan cheese), B√©chamel sauce (white sauce), and rag√π (a meat-based sauce).</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Despite the traditional form still being popular, lasagna has taken on many different recipes over the years. The dish is made by stacking lasagna sheets on top of each other with meats, vegetables, cheeses, and tomato sauce between.</p> 
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"">It is then baked before being served.</p>
    <h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>  
    <ul>
        <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>

        <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>

        <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep the Ingredients:
            <ul>
                <li>Gather all the necessary ingredients: lasagna noodles, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, marinara sauce, ground meat (if using), and any additional vegetables or seasonings.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Cook the Noodles:
            <ul>
                <li>Boil a large pot of water and cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the Filling:
            <ul>
                <li>If using ground meat, brown it in a skillet over medium heat until fully cooked. Mix it with ricotta cheese, some mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese. You can also add any desired herbs or seasonings.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Layer the Lasagna:
            <ul>
                <li>In a baking dish, start by spreading a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom to prevent sticking. Then, layer with lasagna noodles, overlapping them slightly. Spread a portion of the cheese mixture evenly over the noodles.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Repeat Layers:
            <ul>
                <li>Continue layering: noodles, cheese mixture, and sauce until you run out, ensuring the top layer is sauce and cheese.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bake:
            <ul>
                <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in a preheated oven at 375¬∞F (190¬∞C) for about 25-30 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Uncover and Bake Again:
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese on top is bubbly and slightly golden.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Rest Before Serving:
            <ul>
                <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for a few minutes before
